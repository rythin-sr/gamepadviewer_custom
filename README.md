# gamepadviewer_custom

A collection of cutsom skins for the ps4 controller in [gamepadviewer](http://gamepadviewer.com/) by mrmcpowned.

To use, copy the contents of `style.css` and paste in the `Custom CSS` field under Browser in OBS. 
This skin will only work with the standard, black skin for the PS4 controller. 
Supposedly you should be able to include a link to the custom CSS in the actual gamepadviewer URL but I wasn't able to get that to work.
